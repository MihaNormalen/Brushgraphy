The mini_Brushograph was born out of the idea of creating an affordable brush plotter for workshops, which then evolved into a full-fledged project involving many participants. https://wiki.sgmk-ssam.ch/wiki/Brushograph#...or

The goal was to develop a device for less than €50 that would work on all operating systems.

The final result of everything is that the brushograph will be usable via a mobile phone, meaning that a personal computer is not needed to run the workshop.

The Mini Brushograph is a derivative of an existing mini plotter https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579436. 

Several contributors played a key role in its realization:

Vid Vidmar as creator image to gcode script. Pero Čopić worked on coding the program copicograf.py. https://github.com/veselinovicp/brushograph

Matic Potočnik developed the web application Brushograph (in making).

Jurij Podgoršek adapted the fluidNc firmware for unipolar motor drivers https://git.kompot.si/g1smo/FluidNC

Dominik Mahnič served as the project lead and worked on modifying 3D models.

Marc Duseiller contributed with a DIY circuit and tested system functionality https://github.com/dusjagr/Brushograph_PCB.

This collaborative effort resulted in a functional and accessible Mini Brushograph! https://app.assembla.com/spaces/dominik-mahnic/wiki/Mini--opi-ograf
